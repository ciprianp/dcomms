DECENTRALIZED ROUTING PROTOCOL (DRP) WHITEPAPER

CONCEPTS
ID keypair: public + private key
IDspace 8-d space (8 axes) = SHA512(public key) (64bytes) 8bytes per dimension (x,y,z,....)
rendervouz nodes (RN) - entries into p2p network, peers with public IP: port
normalized vector between peers A and M (nvAM): used to hide IDm for A, preserving direction from A to M
connection between peers A,M: {IDa, optionalIDm, nvAM}

SETTLEMENT FLOODING ATTACK
- neighbours limit rate of new peers settled
- signature of "seeder" CA who generates and distributes IDs of sender - packets from such sender has more priority

OCCUPY-FLOOD ATTACK
attacker settles   100 nodes across network.   for 1 month they behave normally. then he starts attack:   1) let his 100 nodes drop all other (not bellonging to attacker) peers   2) generate a flood between the 100 peers, across the network.   it is a very advanced DoS.
here bad means  relaying attacker's packets   but dropping other packets.
it is like you send your agents to enemy, 1000 agents. they first settle and 1 year behave normally. then they get your command to attack
solution: there can be an authority (optionally used in case of such dos). a local authority = government. then in case of dos  -authority-signed packets are routed always first.
"i am french gov. user  -   i trust french government authority - in case of DoS I better trust senders who are signed with french government certificate"
so only signed packets/messages go through during the dos
