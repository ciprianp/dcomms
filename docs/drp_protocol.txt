STEPS:
=================keyPairGen@peerA:
generate keypair, store private key in safe place and at device
calculate SHA256(public key)=32bytes  =IDa (v.1) (v.2 linked to email, with attributes)
encrypted by password
cold hardware wallet? offline device / paper

=================settlement of IDa: possible flooding attack over target ID neighborhood: optionally use "seeder CA"
peerA connects to any node; asks "can I settle to my IDa?";
the network spreads the "settlementRequest" signal to corect neighbours; 
some neighbours reply and get connected to peerA

=================interconnection with peerB@peerA
get IDb from public internet or physically (in-person meeting, QR code)
establish connection via P2P network with peerB

=================initialLookup @peerA
send { IDa, IDb, PoW, sign as IDa }

=================initialLookup routed @peerX

=================initialLookup received @peerB

=================max N hops reached maximum @peerX

=================initialLookupResponse

=================lookup (having preshared key)

=================backup contact book and preshared keys to some trusted place (file?)


PACKETS:
settleRequest+response:  neighbours limit rate of new peers settled
initialLookup+response
pingNeighbour+response (while settled) 
connectToNeighbour+response (give more neighbours) (before and after settlement)


ATTACKS:
========================bad neighbourhood (Sybil attack):
- drop packets
- malform packets: signature protection
- replay packets: duplicate delivery.    neighbors look at unique data, dont proxy duplicates
- write down and track source/dest IDs, ID---IP mapping 

=======================neighbours sniff src/dst IDs
- send many "test" initialLookup packets (fake, not real messages)

recommendation for RATING: do neighbors trust you to proxy real messages or they just take your messages and send you test messages to random test IDs?
-lifetime of ID-ID connection
-delivery rate while ping is online
"broadcast bad neighour signal to close area". when too many IDs.
- policemen build rating out of neighbours (collect ratings)




MONETIZATION MODELS
- DNS: short name-ID(s) linking authority center - when party B is not private
- DUNS: ID to legal name - when party B is not private
- "always online servers" hosting - offline messages, group chats, hosted media (like instagram, micro-websites), hide IP address
